 <h3> introduction</h3>
 <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/"
 target="_blank" title="Real Madrid C.F. official website">Real Madrid Club de Fútbol</a> is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid.
<p style="margin-top: 40px;">Founded on 6 March 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 40px;">The club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world. Real Madrid is one of three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona. The club holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably <strong>El Clásico with Barcelona</strong> and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid.</p>
