 <h3> introduction</h3>
 <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/#"
 target="_blank" title="Liverpool F.C. official website">Liverpool Football Club</a> is a professional football club in Liverpool, England, that competes in the Premier League, the <u>top tier of English football</u>. Domestically, the club has won nineteen League titles, seven FA Cups, a record eight League Cups and fifteen FA Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won <strong>six European Cups, more than any other English club</strong>, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups (also English records) and one FIFA Club World Cup.
<p style="margin-top: 40px;">Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played at Anfield since its formation. Liverpool established itself as a major force in English and European football in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish led the club to a combined eleven League titles and four European Cups. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Benítez and Jürgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a <strong>nineteenth League title</strong> in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League era.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 40px;">Liverpool is one of the most widely supported clubs in the world, as well as one of the most valuable. Liverpool has long-standing rivalries with Manchester United and Everton. The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964 which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is <strong>"You'll Never Walk Alone(YNWA)"</strong>.</p>
